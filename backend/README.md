# Static file serving

Changes from the branch [server_front_end_app](https://github.com/Rikveet/NodeJS-Express-Templates/tree/serve_front_end_app) :
- The React build folder is now used to serve the front end upon request at /.
- It is recommended to add /api in-front of your api endpoints to avoid conflicts of routes.
